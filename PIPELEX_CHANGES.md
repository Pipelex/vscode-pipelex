# Pipelex PML Support - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Added PML (Pipelex Markup Language) support alongside existing TOML support with minimal changes to the original codebase.

## Files Added (New)
- `editors/vscode/src/pipelex/semanticTokenProvider.ts` - PML semantic token provider
- `editors/vscode/src/pipelex/pipelexExtension.ts` - PML feature registration
- `editors/vscode/pml.tmLanguage.json` - PML TextMate grammar
- `editors/vscode/pml.frontmatter.tmLanguage.json` - PML frontmatter support
- `editors/vscode/pml.markdown.tmLanguage.json` - PML markdown code blocks
- `editors/vscode/PIPELEX.md` - Documentation for PML additions
- `test-data/example.pml` - Example PML file

## Files Modified (Minimal Changes)

### `editors/vscode/package.json`
- Added PML language definition alongside TOML
- Added PML grammar references
- Added PML semantic token types (pmlConcept, pmlPipeType, etc.)
- Added PML semantic token scopes

### `editors/vscode/src/extension.ts`
- Added import for `registerPipelexFeatures`
- Added PML language check for schema indicator
- Added call to `registerPipelexFeatures(context)`

### `editors/vscode/src/client.ts`
- Added PML to document selector array

## Design Principles

1. **Additive Only**: PML support is added alongside TOML, not replacing it
2. **Isolated Code**: All PML-specific logic is in `src/pipelex/` directory
3. **Minimal Footprint**: Only essential changes to existing files
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Clear separation makes upstream merges straightforward

## Testing

The extension builds successfully and supports both:
- `.toml` files with all existing features
- `.pml` files with enhanced Pipelex-specific syntax highlighting

## Future Work

- Add PML-specific validation
- Add PML-specific completion providers
- Add PML-specific code actions
- Consider creating a separate "Pipelex Language Support" extension that depends on Even Better TOML
